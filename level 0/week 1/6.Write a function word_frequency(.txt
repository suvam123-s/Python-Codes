6.	Write a function word_frequency(sentence) that takes a sentence as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the sentence. [Hint: split the sentence into words and iterate to check the word frequency.]

def word_frequency(sentence):
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = sentence.split()

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store word frequencies
    word_freq_dict = {}

    # Iterate through the words and update the dictionary
    for word in words:
        # Convert the word to lowercase to handle case sensitivity
        lowercase_word = word.lower()

        # Update the dictionary with the word frequency
        if lowercase_word in word_freq_dict:
            word_freq_dict[lowercase_word] += 1
        else:
            word_freq_dict[lowercase_word] = 1

    return word_freq_dict

# Example usage:
user_sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
result = word_frequency(user_sentence)

# Display the word frequency dictionary
print("Word Frequency Dictionary:")
for word, frequency in result.items():
    print(f"{word}: {frequency}")
