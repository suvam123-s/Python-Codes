6. Write a program to input the number of 5 subjects from the user, calculate the average, total, percentage and division of the students on the basis of specifications mentioned below.
I.	If the percentage value is 80 or above, the user obtains distinction.
II.	If the percentage is above 60, the user obtains first division.
III.	If the percentage is above 50, the user obtains second division.
IV.	If the percentage is above 45, the user obtains third division.
V.	If the percentage is below 45, the user obtains fail division

# Function to calculate average, total, percentage, and division
def calculate_results(subject_marks):
    total_marks = sum(subject_marks)
    average_marks = total_marks / len(subject_marks)
    percentage = (total_marks / (len(subject_marks) * 100)) * 100

    print(f'Total Marks: {total_marks}')
    print(f'Average Marks: {average_marks:.2f}')
    print(f'Percentage: {percentage:.2f}%')

    # Determine division based on percentage
    if percentage >= 80:
        print('Division: Distinction')
    elif percentage >= 60:
        print('Division: First Division')
    elif percentage >= 50:
        print('Division: Second Division')
    elif percentage >= 45:
        print('Division: Third Division')
    else:
        print('Division: Fail Division')

# Input from the user for 5 subjects
subject_marks = []
for i in range(5):
    subject_marks.append(float(input(f'Enter marks for subject {i + 1}: ')))

# Call the function to calculate and display results
