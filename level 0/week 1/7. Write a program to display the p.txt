7. Write a program to display the prime number between 2 numbers input by the users. Also print the sum of all the prime numbers. [Hint: Prime numbers are the one which are either divisible by 1 or themselves. 3, 5, 7, 11, etc are some of the examples.]

# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Function to display prime numbers and their sum between two numbers
def display_prime_numbers_and_sum(start, end):
    prime_numbers = []
    prime_sum = 0

    for number in range(start, end + 1):
        if is_prime(number):
            prime_numbers.append(number)
            prime_sum += number

    print(f'Prime numbers between {start} and {end}: {prime_numbers}')
    print(f'Sum of prime numbers: {prime_sum}')

# Input from the user for two numbers
start_num = int(input('Enter the starting number: '))
end_num = int(input('Enter the ending number: '))

# Call the function to display prime numbers and their sum
display_prime_numbers_and_sum(start_num, end_num)
