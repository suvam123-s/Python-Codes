3. Write a function to accept a list of numbers and print the occurrence of each number. The function should be tested well in the program by calling and sending various list of numbers.

# Function to print the occurrence of each number in a list
def print_occurrence(numbers):
    occurrence_dict = {}

    for num in numbers:
        if num in occurrence_dict:
            occurrence_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            occurrence_dict[num] = 1

    print("Number Occurrence:")
    for num, count in occurrence_dict.items():
        print(f"{num}: {count} times")

# Test the function with various lists of numbers
numbers_list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
numbers_list2 = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
numbers_list3 = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5]

# Call the function with different lists
print_occurrence(numbers_list1)
print("\n")
print_occurrence(numbers_list2)
print("\n")
print_occurrence(numbers_list3)
