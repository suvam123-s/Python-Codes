10.	Write a program to generate a card guessing game for the users in an interesting way. The card should have property such as name and value (e.g. ace 10). Specifications are as mentioned below.
I.	The program should have a list of card values like 2, 3, 4,…., Jack, Queen, King, Ace
II.	The program should have a list of card suits like heart, diamond, club, spades.
III.	The program should randomly pick up a number and a suit and keep as an answer in a separate list.
IV.	The program should ask the player to guess the card value and the suit.
V.	The program should check the player guessed value with the computer answer value. If both the parts don’t match, the program should show a broken heart and game over to the player. If any one of the part of answer matches, the program should show a smily face to the player. If both the guesses of the player matches with the program answer, the program should show a heart and a smily face to the user
